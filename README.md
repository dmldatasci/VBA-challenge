# VBA-challenge
Module 2 submission for UC Berkeley data science bootcamp course.

The VBA script included in this project loops through daily stock data to calculate yearly change, percent change, and total trading volume for all stocks included in the data set. It also extracts maximum and minimum percent change and maximum total trading volume for at-a-glance analysis of performance over a one-year period. 

Data for multiple years is included in the data set, separated into different tabs. The script performs the stated calculations and extractions on all tabs.
